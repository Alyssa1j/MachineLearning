# MachineLearning
This is a machine learning library developed by Alyssa Johnson(u1098788) for
CS5350/6350 in University of Utah

HW1 -> ID3 decision Tree learning Algorithm
HW2 -> run.sh is in folder labeled Ensemble learning and Linear Regression
HW3 -> run.sh is in folder labeled Perceptron, gives hw3_results gives basic usage breakdown. 
HW4 -> run.sh provides an example of how to use SVM and h4 results
HW5 -> run.sh provides an example of how to build a Neural Network and also contains hw4 results
